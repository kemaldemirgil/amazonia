## üå≤ About:
Amazonia is an e-commerce application where users are able to view, add to cart and checkout certain products. The main purpose of this application was to remove the `Context API` and implement `React Redux Store` on a full-stack `MERN` application.

## üìì Usage:
- Please select the items you desire to proceed to the checkout,
- Create and account or sign-in to continue to the payment page,
- Continue your payment on `Stripe Checkoput`

> This is just a test, nothing actually charging the account.

## üß∞ Tools & Dependencies:

### Server
```json
"dependencies": {
    "apollo-server-express": "^2.11.0",
    "bcrypt": "^4.0.1",
    "express": "^4.17.1",

    "jsonwebtoken": "^8.5.1",
    "mongoose": "^5.9.7",
    "stripe": "^8.67.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^2.0.2"
  }
```


### Client
```json
"dependencies": {
    "@apollo/client": "^3.3.7",
    "@stripe/stripe-js": "^1.3.1",
    "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^4.2.4",
    "@testing-library/react": "^9.5.0",

```json
"scripts": {
    "start": "cd server && npm run seed && node server.js",
    "develop": "concurrently \"cd server && npm run watch\" \"cd client && npm start\"",
    "install": "cd server && npm i && cd ../client && npm i",
    "seed": "cd server && npm run seed",
    "build": "cd client && npm run build"
  },
```

## üìä Notes:

> Redux is definitely great on larger size applications but, I would still consider using the `Context API` since it doesn't envolve installing another dependency. I guess it all depends on how you would like build the application. Besides that, I'm glad all the homeworks are done for the `Boot camp` now. After the final project, I would love to start working on personal projects using all these tools and possibly other languages.
